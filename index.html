          <h3>Overview of Where and How to Implement the System</h3>
          <p class="lead">Monitoring one or several frequencies can be beneficial to understanding how your 
            devices communicate and the overall activity of your wireless infrastructure.
            The RF monitoring system described in this project can be comprised anywhere from a 
            single station, or up to an unlimited amount depending on accuracy and area coverage 
            desired. A station or a node is comprised of several elements, a computer configured 
            and pre-set with all the needed software, an internet connection, SDR (HackRF or 
            RTL-SDR), antennas specific to the needed frequency and power supply for all the 
            components.
            </p><p class="lead"> 
            All stations should be evenly spread out across the whole area that will
            be monitored. Depending on the devices and protocols used by those devices, the system
            and its respective nodes could benefit from a closer proximity to each other, 
            especially when the monitored devices have faint signal signature. 
            In our project setup three nodes were established to provide captured signal accuracy 
            and to provide a better general idea of signal location of origin. The nodes of our 
            setup was aligned in a linear pattern with a center and two outer section. The    
            center, concentrated on the monitored device. </p>

          <h3>Station - Computer Configuration</h3>
          <p class="lead"> Any type of computing device which can run Linux is a suitable choice as long as the 
            the hardware capabilities meet the computing needs of the software being run. In most 
            cases this will require a system more powerful than a Raspberry Pi but less powerful
            then a standard desktop computer.
            </p><p class="lead"> 
            Configurating the computer which will execute and host all the activity of a node needs 
            to be able to support the needed software and hardware, because of this a Linux based 
            operating systems is critical. Within the project a Ubuntu based version of Linux was 
            used, Pop OS. However any version newer then 17.10 of Ubuntu will be suitable. In the 
            following Guide a step by step process covers the process of setting a device up with

          <p class="lead"> The SDR tools used for the project are mainly limited to HackRF and RTL-SDR. However
            if there is a need for jamming, for testing purposes, BladeRF and its configuration are 
            covered in the testing tab.

            RTL-SDR setup is summarized with the following commands listed in the Driver <a href="https://ranous.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtl-sdr4linux_quickstartv2-18.pdf">Installation</a> 
            section in the guide by Kenn Ranous. To test if your RTL-SDR is properly recognized when
            connected type the following command in terminal:
            rtl_test -t

            HackRF developer, Michael Ossmann. Through following the prepare instruction and
            installation through package manager, your system will be ready to use a HackRF.

          <h3>GammaRF - Setup and Insight</h3>
          <p class="lead">The main piece of software used to control the SDR attached to the computing device for
            each node is called GammaRF. Through collaboration with the creator of GammaRF, station
            ID can be created and assigned respectively to the needed stations. If running a custom
            GammaRF server, station ID's will be provided by the server administrator. Assigning
            each ID and location with the proper station is important for the software to register the
            stations recordings, this is done in the config file of the software after it is 
            installed and prepared. To install GammaRF and all its needed libraries following
            closely the list of <a href="http://www.gammarf.io/client.html#installation">instructions</a> is important.              
            </p><p class="lead">
            After everything is configured and set you would configure the connector module to
            properly reflect the data streamed over to the GammaRF server toward your database.
            Navigate to the location where GammaRF is installed, then open the modules folder and
            find the connector module and substitute it with the one found in this <a href="https://github.com/sofwerx/es-gammarf/blob/master/gammarf_connector.py">Repository</a>.
            In the place of GAMMARF_ELASTICSEARCH_URL write the URL for your database server, in
            the GAMMARF_ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME write the login (if set), and in
            GAMMARF_ELASTICSEARCH _PASSWORD write the password (if set), for that new
            gammarf_connecter.py file. With that GammaRF should be prepared once more to update
            the modules used, and working without any issues.</p>

          <h3>ElasticSearch</h3>
          <p class="lead">After setup of the all the initial components defining a organized location to store all
           the collected data is very important. This is done trough the setup and use of a database,
           an example of which is ElasticSearch. This would most efficiently be set through Docker and 
           the following ElasticSeach <a href="https://github.com/sofwerx/docker-elastic">build</a>
           The first step is installing the Docker and Compose library by running "install docker - 
           compose". 
           </p><p class="lead"> 
           With Docker configured, going within the directory of the cloned repository for 
           the ElasticSeach build and executing "docker-compose up" in terminal. To test you can 
           check the following <a href="http://localhost:5601">link</a> for activity. To establish the input
           link to attach to the connector module in GammaRF you need the Local IP of the device 
           hosting the database within the monitored network, followed by the index you wish the data 
           to be labeled under and the subindex (Example 'http://192.168.0.129:9200/gammarf/asdf').</p>

          <h3>Zwave and Motion Sensors</h3>
          <p class="lead">Depending on the signal monitored there is a variety of factors to be taken into account.
            Identifying the frequency alone will most of the time sufficient, however understanding 
            the activity of the protocol,  activity of device communication and activity of 
            interference are crucial in identifying a baseline of what you will be monitoring.
            </p><p class="lead"> 
            The protocol, or way of communication between different devices, is the one of the most 
            complicated parts of transferring information. In the Mad Jack's Range project Z-Wave was 
            the monitored protocol. Due to brief communication method the type of monitoring, needed 
            for Z-Wave, required a designated SDR which would constantly calculate the frequency 
            activity. Other protocols like WiFi/GSM/Bluetooth have much higher data input and activity
            and can be averaged every several miliseconds, hence they are monitored through a wide 
            spectrum.
            </p><p class="lead"> 
            Knowing the devices actively interfering/being monitored with the frequency watched helps
            understand where exactly and how much activity there actually is present. Through 
            analyzing signal strength of specific devices, if stationary, they can be easily 
            identified as a characteristic of that device. This overall will help properly organize 
            and the infrastructure, mapping of the devices and the node that will monitor them, and 
            identify the parameters which would separate attacks from your device communicating.</p>

          <h3>Running All Initialized Components</h3>
          <p class="lead">After all hardware and software is properly configured, initialization of each node,
            specifying its role and starting its activity is the final part of the setup. To startup 
            a station you begin by executing the 'sudo ./prepare.sh' command followed by a 'sudo 
            ./rungrf.sh'. Next up is identifying the possible commands within GammaRF through 
            inputting the -help command. This will list all the possible inputs like viewing all 
            connected devices or even running a module on a frequency. Exploring these options is 
            vital for properly implementing the right module and initializing the proper monitoring.
            </p><p class="lead"> 
            To begin capturing data and viewing all the inputs captures you may resort to the 'run'  
            command with the included module, for monitoring wide spectrum 'scanner' or 'single' for
            a single frequency like Z-Wave, finally a digit to define which device it will run on.
            For a wide spectrum of frequencies you will need add each frequency separately. Through 
            using the 'interesting_add [Frequency in Hz]', a frequency is designated to the list of 
            what is watch and recorded. Setting the right parameter in the Single module is 
            important, with it being low, allows for interference to be passed trough the filter, on 
            the other hand a higher parameter will result in not registering all the data hits. 
            Finally seeing what will is captured and listed in the GammaRF interface is important to 
            verify data input in ElasticSearch. This is done through the 'settings' input.</p>

          <p class="lead">The final part of implementing the system is to test and identify the usability and 
            preset a baseline which can be shown as an attack in an algorithm. Some tools useful for
            the testing process are as follows:

            'sudo osmocom_siggen -a hackrf -s 2000000 -f 908420000 -g 67 --sine -x 25000' will enable
            you to transmit a signal at a wanted frequency and verify its effectiveness. However you
            should note that using a HackRF might have insufficient result in jamming due to the 
            weaker power it emits. Verification of the attack should be made through checking the 
            device communication and the database for proper results (lack of communication and 
            increase in hits). 
            </p><p class="lead"> 
            Using any testing involving transmission of signal must include integration of a Faraday 
            cage or other shielding techniques. Otherwise depending on the frequency, transmission of 
            signal could lead to interference with crucial public and private spectrums which are 
            regulated by the FCC. This could lead to tampering important systems and result in a 
            fine.</p>
