              Netflix is committed to open source.  Netflix both leverages and provides open source technology focused on providing the leading Internet television
              network.  Our technology focuses on providing immersive experiences across all internet-connected screens.  Netflix's deployment technology allows for continuous
              build and integration into our worldwide deployments serving members in over 50 countries.  Our focus on reliability defined the
              bar for cloud based elastic deployments with several layers of failover.  Netflix also provides the technology to operate services responsibly with operational
              insight, peak performance, and security.  We provide technologies for data (persistent & semi-persistent) that serve the real-time load to our 62 million members,
              as well as power the big data analytics that allow us to make informed decisions on how to improve our service.  If you want to learn more, jump
